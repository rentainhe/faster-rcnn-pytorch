    """Calculate average precisions based on evaluation code of PASCAL VOC.

    This function evaluates predicted bounding boxes obtained from a dataset
    which has :math:`N` images by using average precision for each class.
    The code is based on the evaluation code used in PASCAL VOC Challenge.

    Args:
        pred_bboxes (iterable of numpy.ndarray): An iterable of :math:`N`
            sets of bounding boxes.
            Its index corresponds to an index for the base dataset.
            Each element of :obj:`pred_bboxes` is a set of coordinates
            of bounding boxes. This is an array whose shape is :math:`(R, 4)`,
            where :math:`R` corresponds
            to the number of bounding boxes, which may vary among boxes.
            The second axis corresponds to
            :math:`y_{min}, x_{min}, y_{max}, x_{max}` of a bounding box.
        pred_labels (iterable of numpy.ndarray): An iterable of labels.
            Similar to :obj:`pred_bboxes`, its index corresponds to an
            index for the base dataset. Its length is :math:`N`.
        pred_scores (iterable of numpy.ndarray): An iterable of confidence
            scores for predicted bounding boxes. Similar to :obj:`pred_bboxes`,
            its index corresponds to an index for the base dataset.
            Its length is :math:`N`.
        gt_bboxes (iterable of numpy.ndarray): An iterable of ground truth
            bounding boxes
            whose length is :math:`N`. An element of :obj:`gt_bboxes` is a
            bounding box whose shape is :math:`(R, 4)`. Note that the number of
            bounding boxes in each image does not need to be same as the number
            of corresponding predicted boxes.
        gt_labels (iterable of numpy.ndarray): An iterable of ground truth
            labels which are organized similarly to :obj:`gt_bboxes`.
        gt_difficults (iterable of numpy.ndarray): An iterable of boolean
            arrays which is organized similarly to :obj:`gt_bboxes`.
            This tells whether the
            corresponding ground truth bounding box is difficult or not.
            By default, this is :obj:`None`. In that case, this function
            considers all bounding boxes to be not difficult.
        iou_thresh (float): A prediction is correct if its Intersection over
            Union with the ground truth is above this value.
        use_07_metric (bool): Whether to use PASCAL VOC 2007 evaluation metric
            for calculating average precision. The default value is
            :obj:`False`.

    Returns:
        dict:

        The keys, value-types and the description of the values are listed
        below.

        * **ap** (*numpy.ndarray*): An array of average precisions. \
            The :math:`l`-th value corresponds to the average precision \
            for class :math:`l`. If class :math:`l` does not exist in \
            either :obj:`pred_labels` or :obj:`gt_labels`, the corresponding \
            value is set to :obj:`numpy.nan`.
        * **map** (*float*): The average of Average Precisions over classes.
